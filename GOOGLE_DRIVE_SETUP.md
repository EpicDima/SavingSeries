# Google Drive Integration Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up Google Drive integration for the SavingSeries application.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Access to Google Cloud Console
- The SavingSeries application running locally or deployed

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page
3. Click "New Project"
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "SavingSeries")
5. Click "Create"
6. Wait for the project to be created and then select it from the project dropdown

## Step 2: Enable Google Drive API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Library**
2. Search for "Google Drive API"
3. Click on the Google Drive API result
4. Click the **Enable** button
5. Wait for the API to be enabled

## Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**
2. Select "External" user type (unless you have a Google Workspace account and want internal only)
3. Click "Create"
4. Fill in the required fields:
    - **App name**: SavingSeries
    - **User support email**: Your email address
    - **Developer contact information**: Your email address
5. Click "Save and Continue"
6. On the Scopes page:
    - Click "Add or Remove Scopes"
    - Search for and select these scopes:
        - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (View and manage Google Drive files that you have opened or
          created with this app)
        - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata` (View and manage its own configuration data in your Google
          Drive)
    - Click "Update"
    - Click "Save and Continue"
7. On the Test Users page (if in testing mode):
    - Click "Add Users"
    - Add your email address and any other test users
    - Click "Save and Continue"
8. Review the summary and click "Back to Dashboard"

## Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**
2. Click **+ Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**
3. Select **Web application** as the Application type
4. Enter a name for your OAuth client (e.g., "SavingSeries Web Client")
5. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
    - For local development: `http://localhost:5173` (or your local dev server port)
    - For production: `https://yourdomain.com` (replace with your actual domain)
    - You can add multiple origins if needed
6. Leave **Authorized redirect URIs** empty (not needed for implicit flow)
7. Click **Create**
8. A dialog will appear with your credentials:
    - **Copy the Client ID** - you'll need this in the next step
    - You can ignore the Client Secret for this implementation

## Step 5: Update Application Configuration

1. Open the file `src/js/config.js` in your SavingSeries project
2. Replace the placeholder with your actual Client ID:
   ```javascript
   // Replace with your actual Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   export const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE.apps.googleusercontent.com';
   ```
   Example:
   ```javascript
   export const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = '123456789012-abcdefghijklmnop.apps.googleusercontent.com';
   ```
3. Save the file

## Step 6: Build and Deploy

### For Development:

```bash
# Install dependencies if you haven't already
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### For Production:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
# or
yarn build

# Deploy the dist folder to your web server
```

## Step 7: Test the Integration

1. Open your application in a web browser
2. Click on the menu (â˜°) button
3. Click on "Google Drive Settings" or the Google Drive icon
4. Click "Login to Google Drive"
5. A Google sign-in window will appear:
    - Select your Google account
    - Review the permissions requested
    - Click "Allow" to grant access
6. Once authenticated, you should see:
    - Status showing "Connected to Google Drive"
    - Your email address displayed
    - Options to sync and logout

## Step 8: Using Google Drive Features

Once connected, you can:

- **Manual Sync**: Click "Sync with Google Drive" to manually backup your data
- **Automatic Backup**: Your data will be automatically backed up periodically
- **Cross-device Sync**: Access your series data from any device by logging into the same Google account

## Troubleshooting

### "Template with id 'googleDriveDialogTemplate' not found" Error

- Ensure the templates.html file has been properly updated
- Clear your browser cache and reload the page
- Check that templates are being injected correctly on page load

### "Invalid Client ID" Error

- Verify the Client ID in config.js matches exactly what's shown in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Check that the Client ID includes the `.apps.googleusercontent.com` suffix

### "Origin not allowed" Error

- Add your current URL to the Authorized JavaScript origins in Google Cloud Console
- For local development, make sure to include the exact port (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
- Wait a few minutes after adding origins for changes to propagate

### "Unauthorized scope" Error

- Ensure both required scopes are added to your OAuth consent screen configuration
- If you modified scopes, users may need to re-authenticate

### Build Errors

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for any syntax errors in the JavaScript files
- Verify all import paths are correct

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit credentials**: The config.js file with your Client ID should be added to .gitignore if it contains
   sensitive information
2. **Use environment variables**: For production, consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding the Client
   ID
3. **Restrict origins**: Only add the specific origins you need in the Google Cloud Console
4. **Regular audits**: Periodically review your Google Cloud Console to ensure no unauthorized access
